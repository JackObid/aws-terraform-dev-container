# Tutorials - AWS Getting Started - Build Infrastructure

This tutorial leverage the HashiCorp lesson [Build Infrastructure](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/aws-build), you will provision an EC2 instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Prerequisites
  A list of things you need, or how to install them.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) - The fastest way to containerize applications
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Visual Studio Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.
- [VSCode Remote Development Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) - An extension pack that lets you open any folder in a container, on a remote machine, or in WSL and take advantage of VS Code's full feature set.


## Installation
If you are using AWS Terraform Dev Container, all the tools should be already installed.



## Usage
Once you have opened your project with VSCode Dev Containers:
1. In the terminal, export the AWS environment variables.
2. Execute the following commands

```bash
make pre-commit/run
```
Notice the warnings and errors raised by [tfsec](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec), [checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov), and/or [terrascan](https://github.com/tenable/terrascan).
These messages allow us to improve the security of our solution overall. For this tutorial, we will ignore them.

```bash
make terraform/plan
make terraform/apply
make terraform/destroy
```

To generate documentation powered by [terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs):
```bash
# you can combine two Make targets
make terraform-docs/init terraform-docs/build
```

To build your project's documentation
```bash
make doc/build
````
Notice the creation, or update, of the README.md.
You can have a closer look into each Make target [here](.devcontainer/lib/make).



## Testing
```
make pre-commit/run terraform/plan
```


## Deployment
```
make terraform/apply
```
