- [Usage](#usage)




## Getting Started

1. On a terminal, inside your Terraform project, execute the following on Mac, Linux or [WSL][wsl]:
```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/aws-terraform-dev-container/main/scripts/init.sh | bash
````
2. Open the folder with VSCode
3. Reopen in Container

To reopen in container manually, open the [command pallete](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) on VS Code and select `Rebuild and Reopen in Container`


## Prerequisites
  A list of things you need, or how to install them.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) - The fastest way to containerize applications
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Visual Studio Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.
- [VSCode Remote Development Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) - An extension pack that lets you open any folder in a container, on a remote machine, or in WSL and take advantage of VS Code's full feature set.



## Usage
```bash
make [tab][tab]
```
For example, if you want to explore the most common [terraform][terraform] commands:
```bash
make terraform/[tab]
apply     clean     destroy   fmt       init      init/     plan      validate  version
```

To display all available commands:
```bash
make help
```
For more information about each [Make targets available](Makefile.md).
